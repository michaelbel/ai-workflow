# Integrating the Play Billing Library

You are wiring the Play Billing Library into an Android app. This skill covers the client side setup: adding the dependency, building `BillingClient`, managing the connection, and querying products. Follow the phases in order.

## Phase 0: Intent

Confirm what the caller actually wants before you touch code. Pick one:

| Intent | Signal |
|---|---|
| First time integration | No `com.android.billingclient` dependency yet |
| Upgrading PBL | Existing `BillingClient` on an older version |
| Fixing connection bugs | `SERVICE_DISCONNECTED`, missing `onBillingSetupFinished` callbacks |
| Adding product queries | `BillingClient` exists, no `queryProductDetailsAsync` call |

If the request is ambiguous, ask. Do not write Gradle edits or Kotlin until you know the target state.

## Phase 1: Discovery

Inspect the project before changing anything.

Check the Gradle setup:

```bash
grep -r "com.android.billingclient" --include="*.gradle*"
```

Check existing BillingClient usage:

```bash
grep -rn "BillingClient" --include="*.kt" --include="*.java" src/
```

Record these facts:

| Fact | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Current PBL version | Drives migration steps (PBL 8 and 9 require `PendingPurchasesParams`) |
| Context passed to builder | Activity contexts leak; prefer `applicationContext` |
| Whether `enablePendingPurchases` is called | Missing call throws `IllegalStateException` on `build()` |
| Whether auto reconnection is enabled | Absent means you own retry logic |
| Where `BillingClient` is instantiated | ViewModel, singleton, or Application scoped |
| Whether KTX is on the classpath | Decides callback vs coroutine style |

If you find multiple `BillingClient` instances in one process, flag it. One instance per process is the rule.

## Phase 2: Plan

Before writing code, pick a connection strategy and confirm with the caller.

| Strategy | Use when | Trade off |
|---|---|---|
| Application scoped singleton | Billing gates many features, frequent status checks | Connection stays open while idle |
| ViewModel / feature scoped | Billing only appears on one or two screens | Pays setup cost every entry |

Then decide:

1. Callback style or KTX coroutine style. If coroutines are already the norm in the project, pick KTX.
2. Auto reconnection on or off. Default to on unless you need manual control.
3. Which product IDs and types (`INAPP`, `SUBS`) the initial query covers. Batch up to 20 per call.

Write the plan down. One BillingClient owner, one listener, one connection strategy.

## Phase 3: Execute

### Step 1 Add the dependency

In the module `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.android.billingclient:billing-ktx:9.0.0")
}
```

The `billing-ktx` artifact pulls in the base library plus coroutine extensions. Drop `-ktx` if you do not want KTX.

### Step 2 Build the BillingClient

Use `applicationContext` to avoid activity leaks:

```kotlin
val billingClient = BillingClient.newBuilder(appContext)
    .setListener(purchasesUpdatedListener)
    .enablePendingPurchases(
        PendingPurchasesParams.newBuilder().build()
    )
    .enableAutoServiceReconnection()
    .build()
```

All four calls are required for a working PBL 9 setup. Missing `setListener` throws `IllegalArgumentException`. Missing `enablePendingPurchases` throws `IllegalStateException`.

### Step 3 Wire the PurchasesUpdatedListener

One listener per client. Dispatch from it if other components need to react:

```kotlin
val purchasesUpdatedListener =
    PurchasesUpdatedListener { result, purchases ->
        when (result.responseCode) {
            BillingResponseCode.OK ->
                purchases?.forEach(::handlePurchase)
            BillingResponseCode.USER_CANCELED -> Unit
            else -> logError(result)
        }
    }
```

The callback fires on the main thread and can fire while the app is in the background. Update a repository or state holder, not UI directly. Never force unwrap `purchases`; it is null on non OK responses.

### Step 4 Start the connection

Callback form:

```kotlin
billingClient.startConnection(object : BillingClientStateListener {
    override fun onBillingSetupFinished(result: BillingResult) {
        if (result.responseCode == BillingResponseCode.OK) {
            onBillingReady()
        }
    }
    override fun onBillingServiceDisconnected() { /* auto retry */ }
})
```

KTX form:

```kotlin
val result = billingClient.startConnection()
if (result.responseCode == BillingResponseCode.OK) {
    onBillingReady()
}
```

Do not call billing methods before `onBillingSetupFinished` fires with `OK`. Queue pending work and flush on each successful connect.

### Step 5 Query product details

Build the product list, mix `INAPP` and `SUBS` in one call, keep each batch at or under 20 products:

```kotlin
val products = listOf(
    QueryProductDetailsParams.Product.newBuilder()
        .setProductId("premium_monthly")
        .setProductType(ProductType.SUBS)
        .build()
)
val params = QueryProductDetailsParams.newBuilder()
    .setProductList(products)
    .build()
```

Callback form:

```kotlin
billingClient.queryProductDetailsAsync(params) { result, list ->
    if (result.responseCode == BillingResponseCode.OK) {
        displayProducts(list)
    }
}
```

KTX form:

```kotlin
val result = billingClient.queryProductDetails(params)
val details = result.productDetailsList
```

Do not cache `ProductDetails` across sessions. Prices can change; re query each time you display products.

### Step 6 Handle UnfetchedProduct results

PBL 8 and 9 return a `QueryProductDetailsResult` that may include `UnfetchedProduct` entries. Branch on the per product response code:

| Code | Action |
|---|---|
| `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | Retry with backoff |
| `SERVICE_TIMEOUT` | Retry with backoff |
| `ERROR` | Retry, then investigate Play Console |
| `DEVELOPER_ERROR` | Do not retry; fix product ID or type |

Cap retries at two or three attempts. Show the products you did fetch and log the rest.

### Step 7 Handle disconnection

With `enableAutoServiceReconnection()`, PBL retries for you using exponential backoff. Your job is only to retry the in flight operation that failed with `SERVICE_DISCONNECTED`. If you disabled auto reconnection, implement backoff yourself starting at one second and capping near fifteen seconds.

Check `billingClient.isReady` before issuing a call if you need a fast path. Always call `endConnection()` when the owning scope is destroyed.

## Phase 4: Verify

Before you mark the integration done, confirm each of these:

| Check | How |
|---|---|
| Dependency present | `./gradlew :app:dependencies` lists `billing-ktx` at the target version |
| Single client per process | `grep -rn "BillingClient.newBuilder" src/` returns one call site |
| `enablePendingPurchases` called | Build passes without `IllegalStateException` at first `build()` |
| Listener fires on purchase | Run a test purchase on the internal track; confirm `OK` branch hit |
| Connection ready before calls | Log `onBillingSetupFinished` and confirm it precedes queries |
| Product query returns details | Log `productDetailsList.size` for a known batch |
| Unfetched handling works | Query a deliberately wrong product ID and confirm you do not retry `DEVELOPER_ERROR` |
| Disconnect recovery | Toggle airplane mode; confirm auto reconnect and that queued work runs |
| `endConnection()` on teardown | Log it in the owning scope's destroy path |

If any row fails, return to Phase 2 and revise the plan. Do not paper over a failing check.
