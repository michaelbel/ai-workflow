# One Time Products

Build a complete Google Play one time product integration with Play Billing Library 9.x. This skill walks through the full lifecycle: querying, launching, handling pending state, and finishing with either consume or acknowledge.

## Phase 0: Intent

Confirm what you are building before writing code. Answer these questions:

- What product type is this? Consumable (repeatable like coins) or non consumable (one time like remove ads)?
- Where does fulfillment happen? Server side verification plus server side consume or acknowledge is the reliable pattern. Client side is acceptable only during early development.
- Which PBL version is the app on? PBL 9.x is assumed. Pending purchases for one time products are enabled explicitly by passing `PendingPurchasesParams.newBuilder().enableOneTimeProducts()` to `enablePendingPurchases()` (required since PBL 8.0; the parameterless overload was removed in 8.0).
- Do you need multi quantity, pre order, or multiple offers on the same product?

If any answer is unclear, stop and gather the requirements. Do not ship a purchase flow with ambiguous fulfillment rules.

## Phase 1: Discovery

Gather the facts that drive the implementation.

| Discovery item | Where to find it |
| --- | --- |
| Product IDs | Play Console, Monetize > Products > In-app products |
| Product state | Must be Active before the app can query or sell |
| Pricing and availability | Play Console product page |
| Tax category | Play Console product page |
| PBL version | App's `build.gradle` billing dependency |
| Backend verification endpoint | Your server code or API spec |
| RTDN subscription | Cloud Pub/Sub topic for `ONE_TIME_PRODUCT_PURCHASED` and `ONE_TIME_PRODUCT_CANCELED` |

Choose naming up front. Good patterns: `coins_100`, `remove_ads`, `level_pack_desert`. Avoid `product_1` or `item_a`. Product IDs are permanent and cannot be reused after deletion.

## Phase 2: Plan

Decide consumable vs non consumable. The choice drives which API you call after granting entitlement.

| Question | Consumable | Non consumable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Can the user buy it again? | Yes | No |
| Typical examples | Coins, lives, boosts | Remove ads, theme pack, level unlock |
| Finalize call | `consumePurchase()` | `acknowledgePurchase()` |
| Stays in purchase history? | No (after consume) | Yes |
| Good fit for multi quantity? | Often | No |

Google Play does not enforce this split at the product configuration level. A product becomes consumable because your code calls `consumePurchase()` on it.

Plan the end to end flow before writing code:

1. Query products with `queryProductDetailsAsync()`.
2. Display products using `formattedPrice`.
3. Launch purchase with `launchBillingFlow()` from an `Activity`.
4. Receive result through `PurchasesUpdatedListener`.
5. Route by `purchaseState`: `PURCHASED`, `PENDING`, or `UNSPECIFIED_STATE`.
6. Verify on your server with the Google Play Developer API.
7. Grant entitlement.
8. Consume (consumable) or acknowledge (non consumable) within 3 days. Aim for seconds.
9. Catch missed purchases with `queryPurchasesAsync()` on launch and resume.

## Phase 3: Execute

### Query product details

One time products use `ProductType.INAPP`. Always check the `BillingResult` response code before reading the list.

```kotlin
suspend fun queryOneTimeProducts(
    billingClient: BillingClient
): List<ProductDetails> {
    val productList = listOf(
        QueryProductDetailsParams.Product.newBuilder()
            .setProductId("coins_100")
            .setProductType(ProductType.INAPP)
            .build()
    )
    val params = QueryProductDetailsParams.newBuilder()
        .setProductList(productList)
        .build()
    val result = billingClient.queryProductDetails(params)
    return result.productDetailsList.orEmpty()
}
```

Use `formattedPrice` directly. It is already localized.

```kotlin
fun displayProduct(productDetails: ProductDetails) {
    val name = productDetails.name
    val description = productDetails.description
    val price = productDetails
        .oneTimePurchaseOfferDetails
        ?.formattedPrice
}
```

### Launch the purchase flow

`launchBillingFlow()` needs an `Activity`. Only one flow can be active at a time.

```kotlin
fun launchPurchase(
    activity: Activity,
    billingClient: BillingClient,
    productDetails: ProductDetails
): BillingResult {
    val productDetailsParams =
        BillingFlowParams.ProductDetailsParams
            .newBuilder()
            .setProductDetails(productDetails)
            .build()
    val flowParams = BillingFlowParams.newBuilder()
        .setProductDetailsParamsList(
            listOf(productDetailsParams)
        )
        .build()
    return billingClient.launchBillingFlow(
        activity, flowParams
    )
}
```

Attach hashed identifiers for fraud detection and backend correlation. Never pass raw user IDs.

```kotlin
val flowParams = BillingFlowParams.newBuilder()
    .setProductDetailsParamsList(listOf(productDetailsParams))
    .setObfuscatedAccountId(hashedUserId)
    .setObfuscatedProfileId(hashedProfileId)
    .build()
```

### Receive the purchase result

```kotlin
private val listener =
    PurchasesUpdatedListener { result, purchases ->
        when (result.responseCode) {
            BillingResponseCode.OK ->
                purchases?.forEach { handlePurchase(it) }
            BillingResponseCode.USER_CANCELED -> {
                // User dismissed the purchase dialog
            }
            else -> {
                // Log and surface an error
            }
        }
    }
```

### Route by purchase state

Never grant, consume, or acknowledge a `PENDING` purchase.

```kotlin
fun handlePurchase(purchase: Purchase) {
    when (purchase.purchaseState) {
        Purchase.PurchaseState.PURCHASED ->
            verifyAndGrantEntitlement(purchase)
        Purchase.PurchaseState.PENDING ->
            showPendingMessage(purchase)
        Purchase.PurchaseState.UNSPECIFIED_STATE -> {
            // Log and investigate
        }
    }
}
```

### Consume a consumable

`consumePurchase()` finalizes the purchase and removes it from history so the user can buy it again. Consume from your server when possible.

```kotlin
suspend fun consumePurchase(
    billingClient: BillingClient,
    purchaseToken: String
) {
    val params = ConsumeParams.newBuilder()
        .setPurchaseToken(purchaseToken)
        .build()
    val result = billingClient.consumePurchase(params)
    if (result.billingResult.responseCode
        == BillingResponseCode.OK
    ) {
        // Purchase consumed
    }
}
```

### Acknowledge a non consumable

Check `purchase.isAcknowledged` first. Calling acknowledge twice returns an error.

```kotlin
suspend fun acknowledgePurchase(
    billingClient: BillingClient,
    purchaseToken: String
) {
    val params = AcknowledgePurchaseParams.newBuilder()
        .setPurchaseToken(purchaseToken)
        .build()
    val result = billingClient.acknowledgePurchase(params)
    if (result.billingResult.responseCode
        == BillingResponseCode.OK
    ) {
        // Purchase acknowledged
    }
}
```

### Handle multi quantity

Always read `purchase.quantity`. For single quantity purchases the value is 1, so the code stays compatible.

```kotlin
fun handleMultiQuantityPurchase(purchase: Purchase) {
    val quantity = purchase.quantity
    grantCoins(userId, quantity * COINS_PER_PACK)
    consumePurchase(billingClient, purchase.purchaseToken)
}
```

### Launch a specific offer

When a product has multiple offers, pass the `offerToken` from the chosen offer.

```kotlin
fun launchPurchaseWithOffer(
    activity: Activity,
    billingClient: BillingClient,
    productDetails: ProductDetails,
    offerToken: String
): BillingResult {
    val params = BillingFlowParams.ProductDetailsParams
        .newBuilder()
        .setProductDetails(productDetails)
        .setOfferToken(offerToken)
        .build()
    val flowParams = BillingFlowParams.newBuilder()
        .setProductDetailsParamsList(listOf(params))
        .build()
    return billingClient.launchBillingFlow(
        activity, flowParams
    )
}
```

### Catch missed purchases

Call `queryPurchasesAsync()` on app launch, on `BillingClient` reconnect, and on `onResume()`.

```kotlin
suspend fun queryExistingPurchases(
    billingClient: BillingClient
): List<Purchase> {
    val params = QueryPurchasesParams.newBuilder()
        .setProductType(ProductType.INAPP)
        .build()
    val result = billingClient.queryPurchasesAsync(params)
    return result.purchasesList
}
```

### Back end verification

The server flow for each `PURCHASED` purchase:

1. Receive the purchase token from the client.
2. Call the Google Play Developer API `purchases.products.get` with the token.
3. Confirm the purchase state, product ID, and expected price.
4. Record the entitlement in your database.
5. Call `purchases.products.consume` or `purchases.products.acknowledge`.
6. Return success to the client only after the finalize call succeeds.

Pair this with RTDN handling so your backend stays in sync with pending transitions and refunds.

## Phase 4: Verify

Run these checks before you ship.

| Check | How to verify |
| --- | --- |
| Products load | `queryProductDetails()` returns the expected items with `formattedPrice` populated |
| Purchase flow opens | `launchBillingFlow()` returns `BillingResponseCode.OK` |
| Purchase state routed | Log each `purchaseState` branch hits the right handler |
| Pending handled | Use a test account with a delayed payment method, confirm no entitlement is granted |
| Consume works | After consume, the product returns from `queryPurchasesAsync()` only if repurchased |
| Acknowledge works | `purchase.isAcknowledged` becomes true after the call |
| 3 day window respected | Fulfillment completes in seconds, not days |
| No hardcoded prices | UI reads `formattedPrice` from `ProductDetails` |
| Missed purchases caught | Force close during a purchase, relaunch, confirm `queryPurchasesAsync()` picks it up |
| Server side verification | Every entitlement grant is preceded by a Developer API verification |
| RTDN subscribed | `ONE_TIME_PRODUCT_PURCHASED` and `ONE_TIME_PRODUCT_CANCELED` notifications reach your backend |

Common pitfalls to scan for:

- Only relying on `PurchasesUpdatedListener` and skipping `queryPurchasesAsync()`.
- Consuming before the server recorded the entitlement.
- Granting entitlement on `PENDING`.
- Hardcoding prices in the UI.
- Ignoring `BillingClient` disconnects. Wrap calls in retry logic and check `isReady`.
- Generic product IDs like `product_1`.
- Skipping server side verification entirely.
