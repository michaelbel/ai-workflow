## Phase 0: Intent

Announce to the user: "I will migrate this project from PBL 7 to PBL 9 in two stages."

State the structure clearly. **There is no direct v7 to v9 shortcut.** Almost all of the breaking work belongs to v8.0.0 (the `Sku*` removals, the proration to replacement mode rename, alternative billing renames, the pending purchases params, the `queryProductDetailsAsync` result shape). v9 itself removed nothing and only adds a target SDK bump plus three small adjustments. So this migration is:

- **Stage A — v7 to v8:** the heavy, mechanical rename work.
- **Stage B — v8 to v9:** the small delta.

This skill is self contained, but each stage links to the dedicated single hop skill if you want the long form: [pbl-v7-to-v8-migration](../pbl-v7-to-v8-migration/) and [pbl-v8-to-v9-migration](../pbl-v8-to-v9-migration/).

Urgency: **PBL 7 stops accepting new app and update submissions on August 31, 2026.** After that date you cannot ship any release (including security fixes) built on v7, so plan to be in production on v9 with margin for monitoring.

## Phase 1: Discovery

1. **Locate the dependency.** Find `com.android.billingclient:billing` in `build.gradle(.kts)` or `libs.versions.toml`. Confirm it reads `7.x` (or `5.x`/`6.x` compiling against v7 APIs — the same steps apply).
2. **Scan for every v7 era identifier.** Grep the repo for each item in the Stage A rename map below. Record every hit; each is an edit site.
3. **Check SDK levels.** Read `minSdk`, `compileSdk`, `targetSdk`. You will move `minSdk` to 23 and `targetSdk` to 35 across the migration.
4. **Check androidx.core.** Record the version; Stage B needs 1.9+.
5. **Note alternative billing and developer provided billing usage.** Grep for `enableAlternativeBilling`, `AlternativeBillingListener`, `AlternativeChoiceDetails`, and `DeveloperProvidedBillingDetails`.

Report back: "You are on PBL [current]. I found [N] v7 call sites across [M] files. Planning a two stage migration: v7 to v8, then v8 to v9.0.0."

## Phase 2: Plan

### Stage A — v7 to v8 removed and renamed APIs

Every item here is a breaking change removed in **PBL 8.0.0**. (Full depth: [pbl-v7-to-v8-migration](../pbl-v7-to-v8-migration/).)

| Area | PBL 7 (removed) | PBL 8 replacement |
|---|---|---|
| Product queries | `querySkuDetailsAsync()` | `queryProductDetailsAsync()` |
| Product details type | `SkuDetails` | `ProductDetails` |
| Query params | `SkuDetailsParams` | `QueryProductDetailsParams` |
| Response listener | `SkuDetailsResponseListener` | `ProductDetailsResponseListener` |
| Product type enum | `BillingClient.SkuType` | `BillingClient.ProductType` |
| Flow params list | `setSkuDetailsList()` | `setProductDetailsParamsList()` |
| Purchase history | `queryPurchaseHistoryAsync()`, `QueryPurchaseHistoryParams` | `queryPurchasesAsync(QueryPurchasesParams, ...)` (active/pending only) |
| Purchases query | `queryPurchasesAsync(String, listener)` | `queryPurchasesAsync(QueryPurchasesParams, listener)` |
| Pending purchases | `enablePendingPurchases()` (no args) | `enablePendingPurchases(PendingPurchasesParams)` |
| Alternative billing toggle | `enableAlternativeBilling()` | `enableUserChoiceBilling()` |
| Alternative billing listener | `AlternativeBillingListener` | `UserChoiceBillingListener` |
| Alternative choice details | `AlternativeChoiceDetails` | `UserChoiceDetails` |
| Proration enum | `ProrationMode` | `ReplacementMode` |
| Proration setter | `setReplaceProrationMode()` | `setSubscriptionReplacementMode()` |

### ProrationMode to ReplacementMode constant map

| `ProrationMode` (PBL 7) | `ReplacementMode` (PBL 8) |
|---|---|
| `IMMEDIATE_WITH_TIME_PRORATION` | `WITH_TIME_PRORATION` |
| `IMMEDIATE_AND_CHARGE_PRORATED_PRICE` | `CHARGE_PRORATED_PRICE` |
| `IMMEDIATE_AND_CHARGE_FULL_PRICE` | `CHARGE_FULL_PRICE` |
| `IMMEDIATE_WITHOUT_PRORATION` | `WITHOUT_PRORATION` |
| `DEFERRED` | `DEFERRED` |
| (none) | `KEEP_EXISTING` (PBL 8.1+) |

### Stage B — v8 to v9 delta

No removals. Four items, most conditional. (Full depth: [pbl-v8-to-v9-migration](../pbl-v8-to-v9-migration/).)

- Bump dependency to 9.0.0 and `targetSdk` to 35.
- Ensure androidx.core 1.9+.
- Blocked Play Store now returns `BILLING_UNAVAILABLE` instead of generic `ERROR`.
- `DeveloperProvidedBillingDetails.getLinkUri()` is now `@Nullable` (only if you use developer provided billing).
- Optional: in app messaging for opt in price increases.

Present both stages as one checklist and confirm before editing.

## Phase 3: Execute

Do Stage A end to end, get a clean compile, then do Stage B. Do not interleave: a clean v8 build is the checkpoint that proves the heavy work is done.

### Stage A: migrate to PBL 8

1. **Bump to the latest v8** (target 8.1+ so you also pick up `SubscriptionProductReplacementParams` and `includeSuspendedSubscriptions`).

   ```gradle
   implementation("com.android.billingclient:billing-ktx:8.1.0")
   ```

2. **Fix the `BillingClient` builder** — replace parameterless `enablePendingPurchases()` and add auto reconnection.

   ```kotlin
   BillingClient.newBuilder(context)
       .setListener(purchasesUpdatedListener)
       .enablePendingPurchases(
           PendingPurchasesParams.newBuilder()
               .enableOneTimeProducts()
               .enablePrepaidPlans()
               .build()
       )
       .enableAutoServiceReconnection()
       .build()
   ```

3. **Replace `querySkuDetailsAsync` with `queryProductDetailsAsync`** and switch display code off `SkuDetails` onto `ProductDetails` (base plans, offers, pricing phases). Read the `QueryProductDetailsResult.unfetchedProductList` in the same pass.
4. **Replace `queryPurchaseHistoryAsync`** with `queryPurchasesAsync` (active/pending only). Move historical lookups to the backend via the Play Developer API.
5. **Rename alternative billing to user choice billing** at every grep hit from Phase 1.
6. **Replace `ProrationMode` with `ReplacementMode`** using the constant map, and rename `setReplaceProrationMode` to `setSubscriptionReplacementMode`. On 8.1+, prefer `SubscriptionProductReplacementParams` attached to the product params.
7. **Bump `minSdk` to 23.** Review ProGuard/R8 keep rules that referenced removed classes (`SkuDetails`, `AlternativeBillingListener`).
8. **Compile clean and run tests.** This is the checkpoint. Resolve every reference to a removed v7 API before moving on.

### Stage B: migrate to PBL 9

Only after a clean v8 build, do the small v9 delta (full depth: [pbl-v8-to-v9-migration](../pbl-v8-to-v9-migration/)):

1. **Bump the dependency to 9.0.0.**

   ```gradle
   implementation("com.android.billingclient:billing-ktx:9.0.0")
   ```

2. **Ensure androidx.core 1.9+** and bump `compileSdk`/`targetSdk` to 35 (`minSdk` stays 23).
3. **Update blocked store error handling** — branch on `BILLING_UNAVAILABLE` with the "Play Store is blocked" debug message instead of generic `ERROR`.
4. **Handle nullable `getLinkUri()`** if you use developer provided billing (null + empty string guard before `Uri.parse`).
5. **Optionally adopt in app price increase messaging** via `showInAppMessages`.

## Phase 4: Verify

1. **Clean compile at v8, then at v9.** Two checkpoints. `./gradlew clean assembleDebug` each time.
2. **Unit tests** at both checkpoints (`./gradlew test`). Fix tests that stub old listener shapes or proration constants.
3. **Lifecycle tests on a real device** with the latest Play Store: new subscription, renewal, upgrade/downgrade with `ReplacementMode`, one time product purchase and consume, pending purchase completion.
4. **License test accounts** — repeat without real charges. Pay special attention to plan changes; the proration to replacement rename is the riskiest site.
5. **Auto reconnection smoke test** — sever the connection (airplane mode / force stop Play Store) and confirm reconnection without a manual `startConnection()`.
6. **v9 specific checks** — blocked store returns `BILLING_UNAVAILABLE`; nullable link URI does not crash; manifests merge at `targetSdk = 35`.
7. **Internal test track rollout** — monitor crash reports and billing success rates for at least one full billing cycle before promoting to production.

Report back a final summary: the old version, the two stage path taken, every rename applied in Stage A, the v9 adjustments in Stage B, and the verification evidence.
