## Phase 0: Intent

Announce to the user: "I will migrate this project from PBL 8 to PBL 9."

State the key fact up front so the user calibrates effort correctly: **PBL 9.0.0 (released 2026-05-19) removed no APIs.** PBL 8.0.0 was the breaking release that deleted the `Sku*` family, `queryPurchaseHistoryAsync`, and the parameterless `enablePendingPurchases()`. PBL 9 builds on that surface with one target SDK bump, two compatibility adjustments, and one optional new feature. RevenueCat characterizes it as a single sprint of work for a v8 app.

If the project still references `SkuDetails`, `querySkuDetailsAsync`, `SkuType`, or the parameterless `enablePendingPurchases()`, the real baseline is pre-v8. Stop and route the user to [pbl-v7-to-v9-migration](../pbl-v7-to-v9-migration/), which does the v8 work first.

## Phase 1: Discovery

Gather the facts before changing anything.

1. **Locate the dependency.** Open `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts`, or `libs.versions.toml` and find `com.android.billingclient:billing` or `billing-ktx`. Confirm the version reads `8.x.x`. If it reads `7.x` or lower, switch to the [pbl-v7-to-v9-migration](../pbl-v7-to-v9-migration/) skill.
2. **Check androidx.core.** Find the `androidx.core:core` / `core-ktx` version. v9's error reclassification requires **androidx.core 1.9 or later**. Record the current value.
3. **Check compile and target SDK.** Read `compileSdk` and `targetSdk`. v9 targets API 35. Note both values.
4. **Scan for developer provided billing.** Grep for `DeveloperProvidedBillingDetails`, `getLinkUri`, `enableDeveloperBillingOption`, and `enableBillingProgram`. These are the External Payments APIs from PBL 8.3. If any hit, the nullable `getLinkUri()` change in Phase 3 applies. If none hit, you can skip that step.
5. **Scan error handling.** Grep for `BillingResponseCode.ERROR` and `BillingResponseCode.BILLING_UNAVAILABLE`. Note every place that branches on a generic `ERROR` for an unavailable store, because v9 reclassifies the blocked store case.
6. **Note in app messaging usage.** Grep for `showInAppMessages` and `InAppMessageParams`. If present, the optional price increase messaging step applies.

Report back: "You are on PBL [current]. androidx.core is [version], targetSdk is [value]. I found [N] developer provided billing sites and [M] generic ERROR branches to review. Planning a migration to PBL 9.0.0."

## Phase 2: Plan

Build the checklist. Only four items are mandatory; the rest are conditional.

| Step | Mandatory? | What it touches |
|---|---|---|
| Bump dependency to 9.0.0 | Yes | `build.gradle` / version catalog |
| Ensure androidx.core 1.9+ | Yes (to get the reclassified error) | `build.gradle` / version catalog |
| Bump compileSdk / targetSdk to 35 | Yes | `build.gradle`, manifest |
| Update blocked store error handling | If you branch on generic `ERROR` for store availability | `PurchasesUpdatedListener`, connection error paths |
| Handle nullable `getLinkUri()` | Only if you use developer provided billing (PBL 8.3 External Payments) | external payment launch code |
| Adopt in app price increase messaging | Optional | paywall / app resume code |

**There is no rename map and no removed API table for v9.** If you find yourself writing one, you are looking at the cumulative v8 migration guide, which restates v8.0.0 removals. Do not reintroduce them here.

Present the plan to the user as a checklist and confirm before editing files.

## Phase 3: Execute

### Step 1: Bump the dependency

```gradle
// Kotlin
implementation("com.android.billingclient:billing-ktx:9.0.0")
// Java/Groovy
implementation "com.android.billingclient:billing:9.0.0"
```

Sync Gradle. Because v9 removed nothing, expect a clean compile with no forced edits. The remaining steps are about correctly handling v9 behavior, not fixing compile errors.

### Step 2: Ensure androidx.core 1.9 or later

The error code reclassification in Step 4 ships behind androidx.core. Confirm the resolved version is 1.9+.

```gradle
implementation("androidx.core:core-ktx:1.13.1")
```

### Step 3: Bump compileSdk and targetSdk to 35

```gradle
android {
    compileSdk = 35
    defaultConfig {
        targetSdk = 35
        minSdk = 23 // unchanged from PBL 8.0
    }
}
```

`minSdk` stays at 23 (set in PBL 8.0). Apps on an older `compileSdk` may see manifest merger warnings until they align to 35.

### Step 4: Update blocked Play Store error handling

When the Play Store app is blocked by the system (OEM customized kids mode, parental controls, or managed enterprise devices), v9 reports **`BILLING_UNAVAILABLE`** instead of the generic `ERROR` it returned in v8. The `BillingResult` carries a "Play Store is blocked" debug message.

```kotlin
when (billingResult.responseCode) {
    BillingResponseCode.BILLING_UNAVAILABLE -> {
        if (billingResult.debugMessage.contains("Play Store is blocked")) {
            showBlockedStoreFallback() // kids tablet / enterprise device messaging
        } else {
            showBillingUnavailable()   // version too old, no Google account, etc.
        }
    }
    BillingResponseCode.ERROR -> showGenericRetry()
    // ...
}
```

Audit every site that previously treated a generic `ERROR` as "store unavailable" and move the blocked case onto `BILLING_UNAVAILABLE`. See [error-handling](../error-handling/) for the full classification.

### Step 5: Handle nullable `getLinkUri()` (developer provided billing only)

PBL 9 marks `DeveloperProvidedBillingDetails.getLinkUri()` as `@Nullable`. The external payment link may not be resolved at selection time, so guard against both `null` and empty string before parsing.

```kotlin
val linkUri = details.linkUri
if (!linkUri.isNullOrEmpty()) {
    startActivity(Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(linkUri)))
} else {
    showExternalPaymentUnavailableState()
}
```

Skip this step if Phase 1 found no developer provided billing usage.

### Step 6: Adopt in app messaging for opt in price increases (optional)

PBL 9 lets you surface an upcoming opt in price increase inside the app so the user can accept the new price without leaving for the Play Store. This reuses the existing `showInAppMessages` entry point. Google shows the message starting the first day the user can accept the increase, at most once every 7 days.

```kotlin
val params = InAppMessageParams.newBuilder()
    .addInAppMessageCategoryToShow(
        InAppMessageParams.InAppMessageCategoryId.TRANSACTIONAL
    ).build()

billingClient.showInAppMessages(activity, params) { result ->
    if (result.responseCode ==
        InAppMessageResult.InAppMessageResponseCode.SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS_UPDATED
    ) {
        refreshSubscriptionStatus() // user accepted the new price in the dialog
    }
}
```

The opt in price increase message is delivered through the same `TRANSACTIONAL` category already used for payment recovery; v9 adds price increases to what that category can surface. Confirm category behavior against the [in app messaging reference](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/integrate#in-app-messaging) for your library version before shipping. See [price-changes](../price-changes/) for the full opt in increase timeline and [payment-recovery](../payment-recovery/) for the existing `showInAppMessages` pattern.

## Phase 4: Verify

1. **Clean compile.** Run `./gradlew clean assembleDebug`. v9 should compile without forced changes; investigate any error as a sign the baseline was actually pre-v8.
2. **Unit tests.** Run `./gradlew test`.
3. **Blocked store path.** On a device or emulator where the Play Store is restricted (kids mode, managed profile), confirm the response code is now `BILLING_UNAVAILABLE` with the "Play Store is blocked" debug message, and that your fallback UI shows.
4. **Nullable link URI.** If you use developer provided billing, force a state where the link URI is unavailable and confirm no `Uri.parse("")` crash.
5. **targetSdk 35.** Confirm the build merges manifests cleanly at `targetSdk = 35` and the app behaves correctly under Android 15 behavior changes.
6. **Price increase messaging.** If adopted, configure an opt in increase in the Play Console and confirm the in app message renders and `SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS_UPDATED` refreshes entitlement state.
7. **Internal test track rollout.** Publish to the internal track, monitor crash reports and billing success rates for at least one billing cycle before promoting.

Report back a final summary: the old version, the new version (9.0.0), the conditional steps that applied, new behavior adopted, and the verification evidence.
