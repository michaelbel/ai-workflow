# Purchase Flow

Implements the full client side purchase sequence: build `BillingFlowParams`, launch `launchBillingFlow()`, receive callbacks in `PurchasesUpdatedListener`, handle every response code, then verify, acknowledge, and grant access.

## Phase 0: Intent

Use this skill when you need to:

- Launch a purchase from a "Buy" tap for a one time product or a subscription.
- Wire a `PurchasesUpdatedListener` and handle every `BillingResponseCode`.
- Decide where to verify, where to acknowledge, and how to grant entitlements idempotently.
- Support pending transactions (cash at convenience store, carrier billing, slow card auth).
- Bundle multiple items into a single transaction (PBL 7.0+).

Out of scope: connecting `BillingClient`, querying `ProductDetails`, subscription upgrades or downgrades, and retry or error taxonomy beyond the launch results listed below.

## Phase 1: Discovery

Confirm the preconditions before you build params.

| Check | How | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `BillingClient` connected | `billingClient.isReady == true` | Calls fail without a live connection. |
| `ProductDetails` cached | Held from a prior `queryProductDetailsAsync` | Required input to `ProductDetailsParams`. |
| Pending purchases enabled | `BillingClient.Builder.enablePendingPurchases(...)` was called | Users with delayed payment cannot buy otherwise. |
| Existing ownership known | Ran `queryPurchasesAsync()` recently | Prevents `ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED` surprises. |
| Offer token resolved (subs only) | Selected from `subscriptionOfferDetails` | Missing token returns `DEVELOPER_ERROR`. |

Record the product type (`INAPP` vs `SUBS`), the selected `basePlanId`, and the chosen `offerToken` before moving on.

## Phase 2: Plan

Decide the following before you call `newBuilder()`.

### Account identifiers

- **obfuscatedAccountId**: attach a one way hash of your internal user id. Never pass raw email or plain text. Helps Google Play detect fraud across devices.
- **obfuscatedProfileId**: attach only if your app has multiple profiles under one account (family streaming, kid profiles).

### Offer personalization

- Set `setIsOfferPersonalized(true)` only if the price was chosen by automated decision making for this user. EU regulation requires a disclosure, which Google Play renders for you.
- Default is `false`. Do not set `true` for uniform promotional pricing.

### Offer token selection (subscriptions)

Group offers by base plan, then pick the best eligible offer. Google already filters offers the user cannot redeem.

```kotlin
val offersByPlan = productDetails
    .subscriptionOfferDetails
    ?.groupBy { it.basePlanId }
    ?: emptyMap()

val chosenOffer = offersByPlan[selectedBasePlanId]
    ?.firstOrNull() ?: return
```

Whatever the user tapped in your UI must map to the exact `offerToken` you pass. Show the first `pricingPhases` entry (free trial, intro price) in the UI and the recurring phase after it.

### Backend contract

Decide whether acknowledge and grant happen server side (primary) or client side (fallback). Server side keeps verify, grant, and acknowledge in one transaction. Keep client side as a fallback when the server is unreachable.

## Phase 3: Execute

### Build params for a one time product

```kotlin
val productDetailsParams = BillingFlowParams.ProductDetailsParams
    .newBuilder()
    .setProductDetails(productDetails)
    .build()

val flowParams = BillingFlowParams.newBuilder()
    .setProductDetailsParamsList(listOf(productDetailsParams))
    .setObfuscatedAccountId(hashUserId(currentUser.id))
    .build()
```

### Build params for a subscription

```kotlin
val productDetailsParams = BillingFlowParams.ProductDetailsParams
    .newBuilder()
    .setProductDetails(productDetails)
    .setOfferToken(chosenOffer.offerToken)
    .build()

val flowParams = BillingFlowParams.newBuilder()
    .setProductDetailsParamsList(listOf(productDetailsParams))
    .build()
```

### Launch the flow

```kotlin
val result = billingClient.launchBillingFlow(activity, flowParams)
if (result.responseCode != BillingResponseCode.OK) {
    handleLaunchError(result)
}
```

You must pass the current `Activity`. `OK` here means the dialog was shown, not that payment succeeded. The real result arrives in `PurchasesUpdatedListener`.

### Handle launch response codes

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `OK` | Dialog shown | Wait for listener callback. |
| `ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED` | User owns product or has unacknowledged purchase | Refresh via `queryPurchasesAsync()` and process it. |
| `DEVELOPER_ERROR` | Bad params, missing offer token, wrong package name | Fix params, check Console listing. |
| `FEATURE_NOT_SUPPORTED` | Device or Play Store does not support the product type | Hide the buy button on this device. |
| `BILLING_UNAVAILABLE` | No Google account or Play Services missing | Prompt user to sign in to Play. |
| `ITEM_UNAVAILABLE` | Not available in region or deactivated | Check Console availability. |
| `NETWORK_ERROR` | Cannot reach Play servers | Retry after delay, do not loop aggressively. |

### Receive purchase results

```kotlin
val listener = PurchasesUpdatedListener { result, purchases ->
    when (result.responseCode) {
        BillingResponseCode.OK ->
            purchases?.forEach { handlePurchase(it) }
        BillingResponseCode.USER_CANCELED -> Unit
        BillingResponseCode.ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED ->
            refreshPurchases()
        else -> handleError(result)
    }
}
```

### Process a successful purchase (5 steps)

1. **Verify server side.** Post `purchase.purchaseToken` to your backend. Backend calls `purchases.products.get` (one time) or `purchases.subscriptionsv2.get` (subs). Check `purchaseState == 0`, `productId`, `packageName`, `orderId` not seen before, and for subs `expiryTimeMillis`.
2. **Check `purchase.purchaseState`.** Grant only on `PURCHASED`. Show pending UI on `PENDING`. Log on `UNSPECIFIED_STATE`.
3. **Grant entitlement idempotently.** Use `purchaseToken` as a unique key. A retry, an RTDN, and a second device query must not stack grants.
4. **Acknowledge or consume within 3 days.**

   ```kotlin
   // Non consumable and subscriptions
   val ackParams = AcknowledgePurchaseParams.newBuilder()
       .setPurchaseToken(purchase.purchaseToken)
       .build()
   billingClient.acknowledgePurchase(ackParams) { r -> /* check OK */ }
   ```

   ```kotlin
   // Consumable
   val consumeParams = ConsumeParams.newBuilder()
       .setPurchaseToken(purchase.purchaseToken)
       .build()
   billingClient.consumeAsync(consumeParams) { r, t -> /* check OK */ }
   ```

   Prefer server side acknowledgement. Fall back to client side only after retries fail.
5. **Notify the user.** Show specific confirmation ("You now have Premium") immediately from the client. For subs, show next billing date and a link to `https://play.google.com/store/account/subscriptions`. Return the user to the content they were trying to unlock.

### Handle pending transactions

```kotlin
fun handlePurchase(purchase: Purchase) {
    when (purchase.purchaseState) {
        Purchase.PurchaseState.PENDING -> {
            showPendingMessage(purchase)
            return
        }
        Purchase.PurchaseState.PURCHASED -> {
            if (!purchase.isAcknowledged) verifyAndGrantAccess(purchase)
        }
    }
}
```

Transitions arrive via a later `PurchasesUpdatedListener` fire, an RTDN on your server, or a fresh `queryPurchasesAsync()`.

### Call queryPurchasesAsync at the right moments

- **On connect**: right after `startConnection()` succeeds. Catches cross device purchases and reinstalls.
- **On app launch**: keeps local entitlement cache honest against refunds and expirations.
- **On foreground resume**: catches cancellations in Play Store and pending purchases that completed in the background.

### Multi line item purchases (PBL 7.0+)

Add multiple `ProductDetailsParams` entries to the list. All items must share a product type (subs or inapp). One purchase token covers the bundle, so acknowledge once, then iterate `purchase.products` to grant every item.

## Phase 4: Verify

Prove the flow works before calling it done.

- [ ] `launchBillingFlow()` returns `OK` for a real product in an internal test track.
- [ ] `PurchasesUpdatedListener` fires with `OK` and a non null `purchases` list on success, and with `USER_CANCELED` when the user dismisses the dialog.
- [ ] Every branch in the response code table above has a code path and a log line.
- [ ] Server side verification runs before `grantEntitlement`. Granting twice with the same token produces the same result (idempotency test).
- [ ] Every `PURCHASED` purchase is acknowledged or consumed within 3 days. Monitor unacknowledged count.
- [ ] A test with a delayed payment method (use the tester card or a convenience store flow in a test region) surfaces a pending state and does not grant access.
- [ ] A subscription purchase without `setOfferToken` returns `DEVELOPER_ERROR` (negative test) and your code surfaces it cleanly.
- [ ] `queryPurchasesAsync()` is wired to connect, app launch, and `onResume`.
- [ ] For multi line bundles, `purchase.products` yields every product id and each gets an entitlement.
