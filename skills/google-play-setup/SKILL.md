## Phase 0: Intent

Use this skill when any of the following is true:

- You are starting a new Android billing integration and have not yet configured Play Console, products, API access, or RTDN.
- A teammate asks you to "set up Play billing" or "wire up server side purchase notifications" before any code lands.
- You hit errors like "This version of the app is not configured for billing through Google Play", 403 responses from the Google Play Developer API, or missing Pub/Sub test notifications, and you need to retrace the environment setup.

Outcome: a verified environment with a Play Developer account, a linked Payments profile, an internal test track build, at least one active product, a service account with the right Play Console roles, and a Pub/Sub topic receiving Real Time Developer Notifications.

## Phase 1: Discovery

Gather facts before changing anything. Ask or check:

1. Does the developer account already exist, and is it individual or organization? Organization verification can take up to two weeks.
2. Is there a verified Google Payments Center profile? Without it, you cannot create paid products or publish in app purchases.
3. What is the app's package name, signing configuration, and current Play Console upload state (any track)?
4. Which GCP project is linked to the Play Console app? RTDN and the Play Developer API both depend on this link.
5. Does a service account already exist for this backend, and which roles are granted in the Play Console (not only in GCP IAM)?
6. Is there an existing Pub/Sub topic, and has `google-play-developer-notifications@system.gserviceaccount.com` been granted Publisher on it?
7. Will the server side consumer use a push subscription (public HTTPS endpoint) or a pull subscription (firewalled or batched)?

If any answer is "unknown," treat it as a discovery task before executing Phase 3.

## Phase 2: Plan

Work top down. Each step unblocks the next, so do not skip ahead.

1. Register and verify the Google Play Developer Account; pay the one time $25 fee.
2. Create and verify the Google Payments Center profile and tax information.
3. Add the Play Billing Library 9.x dependency and upload a signed build to the internal test track.
4. Create at least one product (one time product or subscription) and activate it.
5. Link a GCP project to the Play Console app, create a service account, and grant minimum Play Console roles.
6. Create a Pub/Sub topic, grant Google publish access, and create a push or pull subscription.
7. Point Play Console RTDN at the full topic name and send a test notification.

Stop and re-plan if Payments verification, identity verification, or the GCP link is incomplete. Later steps will silently fail otherwise.

## Phase 3: Execute

### 3.1 Play Console app setup

1. Register at `play.google.com/console`. Choose individual or organization; organization unlocks managed publishing and team roles.
2. Complete identity verification. Keep business registration, government issued ID, and proof of address accessible for organization accounts.
3. Create the app at **All apps > Create app**. Fill name, default language, app type, and free or paid.
4. Complete content, ads, and target audience declarations and add a privacy policy URL. Placeholder store listing content is fine for internal testing, but the privacy policy URL is required on every track.
5. Create the Payments profile at **Setup > Payments profile** with bank, business, and tax details. Wait for verification before creating paid products.

Add the Play Billing Library to the app module `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    val billingVersion = "9.0.0"
    implementation(
        "com.android.billingclient:billing-ktx:$billingVersion"
    )
}
```

If the project uses a version catalog, define the version in `libs.versions.toml`:

```kotlin
[versions]
billing = "9.0.0"

[libraries]
billing-ktx = {
    module = "com.android.billingclient:billing-ktx",
    version.ref = "billing"
}
```

Pin the version explicitly. PBL 9 requires `minSdk` 23, targets `compileSdk`/`targetSdk` 35, and depends on androidx.core 1.9 or later; an up to date Google Play Store app must be on the test device. Confirm `google()` and `mavenCentral()` are present in `settings.gradle.kts`.

Upload to the internal test track:

1. Build a signed APK or App Bundle. Use Play App Signing on the first upload.
2. Go to **Testing > Internal testing** and create a new release.
3. Upload the artifact and add testers by Google account email.
4. Roll out. Testers must accept the opt in link before installing from the Play Store.

Internal releases publish in minutes with no review. Use closed testing (up to 200 email lists) or open testing for broader audiences later.

### 3.2 Product and subscription creation

Create a one time product:

1. Go to **Monetize > Products > In-app products > Create product**.
2. Enter a Product ID such as `remove_ads`. The ID is permanent and cannot be reused once activated.
3. Set name, description, default price, tax and compliance settings.
4. Click **Activate**.

Use a `<category>_<descriptor>` naming scheme (`premium_monthly`, `coins_500`, `remove_ads`). Keep IDs lowercase with underscores. Do not encode prices or promotions in the ID.

For subscriptions, create a Subscription, then add Base Plans and Offers inside it. A consistent scheme such as `premium_monthly` (subscription), `standard` (base plan), and `intro_7d_free` (offer) stays readable during later debugging.

Newly activated products can take a few minutes to propagate. If `queryProductDetails` returns empty immediately after activation, wait and retry.

### 3.3 Service account provisioning for the Google Play Developer API

Create the service account in GCP, then grant Play Console roles separately.

1. In the Google Cloud Console, select or create a project and link it to the Play Console app.
2. Go to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts > Create Service Account** and name it (for example `play-billing-backend`).
3. Create a JSON key and download it to a secrets manager. Do not commit it or embed it in a client.
4. In the Play Console, go to **Setup > API access**, link the GCP project if needed, and grant the service account the roles below.

Grant only the roles the backend needs. Play Console permissions are separate from GCP IAM.

| Play Console role | Purpose | Grant when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| View financial data | Read revenue reports and financial information | Backend reads reporting data |
| Manage orders and subscriptions | Verify purchases, acknowledge transactions, revoke subscriptions, issue refunds | Backend validates purchases or manages subscriptions |
| Admin (all permissions) | Full account control | Avoid unless a specific task requires it |

Use separate service accounts for separate purposes (for example, purchase verification versus analytics). Rotate keys periodically; up to 10 keys per service account are allowed so you can deploy a new key before deleting the old. For Cloud Run, GKE, or App Engine, prefer workload identity federation over downloaded key files.

Test API access with a read call such as listing in app products:

```kotlin
// Server side Kotlin using google-api-services
val transport = GoogleNetHttpTransport.newTrustedTransport()
val credential = GoogleCredentials
    .fromStream(FileInputStream("service-account.json"))
    .createScoped(
        "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/androidpublisher"
    )
val publisher = AndroidPublisher.Builder(
    transport,
    GsonFactory.getDefaultInstance(),
    HttpCredentialsAdapter(credential)
).setApplicationName("your-app").build()
```

### 3.4 Pub/Sub topic and RTDN configuration

Create the topic:

1. In the Google Cloud Console, go to **Pub/Sub > Topics > Create Topic**.
2. Name it descriptively (for example `play-billing-notifications`).
3. Keep default settings and create.

Grant Google publish access:

1. Open the topic and click **Permissions**.
2. Add principal `google-play-developer-notifications@system.gserviceaccount.com`.
3. Assign role **Pub/Sub Publisher**.

Create a subscription. Pick the delivery model that matches your infrastructure.

| Subscription type | How it delivers | Choose when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Push | Pub/Sub sends HTTP POST with a base64 JSON payload; endpoint must return 2xx | You have a public HTTPS endpoint and want the simplest path |
| Pull | Your server calls the Pub/Sub API to fetch and acknowledge messages | Server sits behind a firewall, batches work, or needs concurrency control |

Configure a dead letter topic. Pub/Sub retries failed messages indefinitely by default. Set a maximum delivery attempt count (allowed between 5 and 100) so undeliverable messages land on the dead letter topic rather than looping. Monitor the dead letter topic; messages there are events your system did not process.

Each RTDN message payload looks like:

```kotlin
// Decoded Pub/Sub message payload
{
    "version": "1.0",
    "packageName": "com.example.app",
    "eventTimeMillis": "1234567890123",
    "subscriptionNotification": {
        "version": "1.0",
        "notificationType": 4,
        "purchaseToken": "abc123...",
        "subscriptionId": "premium_monthly"
    }
}
```

Enable RTDN in the Play Console:

1. Go to **Monetize > Monetization setup**.
2. Under **Real time developer notifications**, enter the full topic name `projects/your-project-id/topics/play-billing-notifications`.
3. Save.

## Phase 4: Verify

Send a test notification and walk the environment checklist.

1. In the Play Console RTDN settings, click **Send test notification**.
2. Confirm the message arrives at the Pub/Sub subscription. For push, confirm the endpoint received an HTTP POST and returned 200.
3. The payload contains a `testNotification` field instead of `subscriptionNotification` or `oneTimeProductNotification`. The handler should acknowledge it without treating it as a real event.

If the test never arrives, check each link in the chain:

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "This version of the app is not configured for billing through Google Play" | App not on a test track, version code mismatch, or wrong signing key | Install the exact signed build uploaded to the Play Console |
| `queryProductDetails` returns empty | Product not Active, wrong ID or type, or propagation delay | Activate the product; verify ID and INAPP vs SUBS; wait a few minutes |
| 403 from Google Play Developer API | Missing Play Console role or GCP project not linked | Link GCP in **Setup > API access**; grant roles in Play Console, not only GCP IAM |
| RTDN test never arrives | Wrong topic name, missing Publisher role, unreachable push endpoint | Match full topic name; grant Publisher to `google-play-developer-notifications@system.gserviceaccount.com`; verify HTTPS endpoint returns 200 |
| "The developer account associated with this app is not eligible for testing" | Testing with the developer account itself | Use a different Google account and add it under **Setup > License testing** |
| Gradle fails to resolve billing library | Missing repositories or proxy block | Add `google()` and `mavenCentral()` in `settings.gradle.kts`; configure proxy if needed |

Final environment checklist:

- [ ] Google Play Developer Account registered and verified
- [ ] Google Payments Center profile linked and verified
- [ ] Play Billing Library 9.x pinned in app dependencies
- [ ] App uploaded to the internal test track
- [ ] At least one product created and activated
- [ ] Service account created with minimum Play Console roles
- [ ] Cloud Pub/Sub topic created with Google Publisher permission
- [ ] Push or pull subscription configured (with dead letter topic)
- [ ] RTDN enabled in Play Console pointing to the full topic name
- [ ] Test notification sent and acknowledged

When every item is checked, the environment is ready for the billing code that follows in later chapters.
